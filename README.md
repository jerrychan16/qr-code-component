## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox for layout and centering
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Google Fonts (Outfit)

### What I learned

This project helped me understand:
- **Flexbox centering**: Using `display: flex`, `justify-content: center`, and `align-items: center` for perfect centering
- **Responsive design**: Creating layouts that work across different screen sizes using media queries
- **Component-based thinking**: Building self-contained UI components with proper spacing and typography

### Continued development

Areas I want to focus on in future projects:
- Image sizing strategies
- Advanced CSS Grid layouts
- CSS custom properties for better maintainability

### Useful resources

- CSS Flexbox Guide- Helped me understand flexbox centering
